TODO 
====

A lot of this depends on what the client wants. The "core" component that is left to implement is project editing within
the application. We were unable to come up with an adequate solution in time, so that task will be left up to whoever
picks this project back up. However, there are a couple known outstanding tasks. 

1. Security stuff. Add SSL for requests and just all around clean up any security vulnerabilities.
1. Change the database to something more "production ready". SQLITE was meant to be used for prototyping only. 
1. Uploading and storing project files. We were discussing using AWS or Azure, but we ran out of time. 
1. Email confirmation for sending out new account invites. 
1. Some sort of account recovery so for if a user forgets the password. 


That's it off the top of my head! Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions!
